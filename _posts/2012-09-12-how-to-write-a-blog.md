Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` di


{% highlight java %}

class Goofy {


  private String goober;

  public Goofy(String s){
   goober = s;
  }

  static public void main(String... args){
    System.out.println(new Goofy("IM A GOOFY GOOBER");
  } 

  @Override
  public String toString(){
    return s;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
