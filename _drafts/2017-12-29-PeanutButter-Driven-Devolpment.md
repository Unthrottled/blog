Test Driven Development (TDD) is a highly powerful tool to construct well written, maintainable, and correct code.
However, there seems to be a missing step when a majority of people talk about TDD. 
Hopefully, this post will be able to make TDD more approachable and explain the real value behind the methodology.
In addition to learning how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich!

A quick Google search for TDD will most likely lead to article prescribing the following bland steps:

1. Add a test
1. Run all tests and see if the new test fails.
1. Write the code.
1. Run tests.
1. Refactor code.
1. Repeat until all tests pass and code looks great!
