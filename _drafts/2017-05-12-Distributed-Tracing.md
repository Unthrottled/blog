The term _microservice_ means difference things to many different people.
Some, including myself, might call it freedom from the oppressive monolith and chains that must be bared when working on one.
Allowing developers to spread there wings and fly, without having to worry if the changes they made did not break some obscure part of the codebase.
Enabling releases of code early and often, shedding the fear going to production and delivering code that matters.

Others might be boring, not into the hype, and just cite wikipedia to define this _buzzword_.

>Microservices is a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
