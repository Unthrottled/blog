For those who are curious, [Acari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acari) are a taxon of arachnids that contains mites and ticks.
There are many pronunciations of the word, right or wrong I have chosen [uh-kar-ree].

I am an energetic, effective, and efficient professional Software Engineer (who also likes alliteration).
That is my current job title, you could also call me a software developer, a programmer, tech enthusiast, software craftsman, or anything that tickles your fancy (except late for dinner).

What drives me everyday is knowing that today, I have the chance to learn something I did not know the day before.
I spend a lot of my free time consuming knowledge other techno geeks are so kind enough to produce.
I go though all of these talks, articles, blogs, papers etc, that I want to give back. 
I have been aggregating a wealth of ideas, concepts, and explanations, I want to give back.
All these cool things I have learned from others should not just be mine. 
So here we are! 
I aspire to give a talk one day, just being able to get up in front of someone and gush about something.

I really want to be the best I can be. Whether it is at my job or my physical performance. 
When I am not one with the computer, I am probably upkeeping my health. 
To me, health is wellness of the mind and body. 
I am always facing forward, only looking back to help others where I could have done something better. 

When crafting software, sometimes it takes the longest amount of time to find the tiniest bug. 
I hope that I can provide someone tweezers!
