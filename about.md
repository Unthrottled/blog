What is Acari? I know that nobody is asking about it, but I am going to straight up answer it anyways. 
[Acari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acari) are a taxon of tiny arachnids which contains things like: mites and ticks (small bugs, heh).
It is poetic in a way. When building software, sometimes it takes the longest amount of time to find the tiniest bug.

I assume that since you are looking at this page, you would like to know about one or two things.
The first being, what is the point of all of this? While the second being, who am I?

Starting off with the latter, a 10,000 foot description of myself would be: a highly driven individual determined to reach his full potential.
You can find more about my other most valued principals at my home site [https://acari.io](https://acari.io)

While I am currently a software craftsman by trade. 
I also consider myself to be a finance hippie, math enthusiast, semi-well-rounded technology connoisseur, art dabbler, and (most importantly) passionate athlete.
With a **strong** emphasis on the athlete part. I do not think that I would be at the level of my current level of throughput if I did not take really good care of my physical and mental health _ᕙ(◕ل͜◕)ᕗ_.

To me, health is wellness of the mind and body. 
Things like push-ups, pull-ups, cycling, and running are great way to maintain a happy body.
Quick shout out to Jeff Cavaliere's programs @ [Athlean-x](https://athleanx.com), be prepared to get your rear in gear.

However, physical health is just half of the equation. 
Keeping a positive outlook on life by being great to others, and not letting negative stress overwhelm you is the other half.
Meditation is a great place to start with becoming mindful, another plug, this time for [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/). Their programs are helping me keep my head clear.
I am always facing forward, only looking back to help others with things I have done, so they can do it better. 

What drives me everyday is knowing that today, I have the chance to learn something I did not know the day before.
I spend a lot of my free time consuming knowledge and wisdom other geeks that are kind enough to produce.
All the time I spend listening to talks, watching lectures, reading articles, blogs, papers etc, that I want to give back a good summation of the knowledge I received. 
I have been aggregating a wealth of ideas, concepts, and explanations.
All these cool things I have learned from others should not just be mine. 

So here we are! 
I aspire to give a talk at a convention one day. 
Just being able to get up in front of someone and present something I am passionate about is great as well.
As an example, I gave a talk about reactive programming, whose slides you can find on my other website [http://learn.acari.io](https://learn.acari.io/reactive/explanations).

This blog is also an exercise of communication. 
After finishing my undergraduate work and entered the professional workforce, I came across one of my weak-points.
That being communication.
I found it difficult and frustrating, trying to talk with others and not being able to articulate what I wanted to say, especially during code review.
It was a mix of knowing what I meant internally, but when trying to make it external, it was just babble.
However, I eventually stumbled across something that help greatly me increase my communication skills.
Which was solidifying my knowledge on a vast variety of subjects by knowing enough about them in order to be able to teach them.

I have heard this saying a bunch: "You never know how well you know a subject until you have to teach somebody else it."
So it became quite apparent to me that I did not know much about many things. 
At least at the depth of understanding that was required to teach it to others. 
This I why I spend a lot of my free time learning and practicing my communication skills. 
Hopefully, you will be able to see the progression that I have been making throughout my days. 
Granted, I hope that trend is moving up and not down!

That is about as much I would like to give you without becoming boring or handing you my life's story.

>Go forth and dedicate to being great!
