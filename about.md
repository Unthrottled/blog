For those who are curious, [Acari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acari) are a taxon of arachnids that contains mites and ticks.
If you are wondering how to pronounce it, I have chosen this one -> [ak-uh-ree].

I assume that since you are looking at this page, you would like to know about one or two things.
The first being, what is the point of all of this? While the second being, who am I?

Starting off with the latter, a good synopsis of myself is that I am an energetic, effective, and efficient programmer.
I am currently a professional software engineer by trade. I consider myself to be tech enthusiast, software craftsman, and athlete.

What drives me everyday is knowing that today, I have the chance to learn something I did not know the day before.
I spend a lot of my free time consuming knowledge other techno geeks are so kind enough to produce.
All the time I spend listening to talks, watching lectures, reading articles, blogs, papers etc, that I want to give back the knowledge I receive. 
I have been aggregating a wealth of ideas, concepts, and explanations.
All these cool things I have learned from others should not just be mine. 
So here we are! 
I aspire to give a talk one day, just being able to get up in front of someone and just present something I am passionate about.

This blog is also an exercise of communication. 
After finishing my undergraduate work and entered the professional workforce, I came across one of my weak-points.
That being communication.
I found it difficult and frustrating, trying to talk with others and not being able to articulate what I wanted to say, especially during code review.
It was a mix of knowing what I meant internally, but when trying to make it external, it was just babble.
However, I eventually stumbled across something that help greatly me increase my communication skills.
Aside from just plain practice, solidifying my knowledge on a vast variety of subjects also help me convey my thoughts better.

I have heard this saying a bunch: "You never know how well you know a subject until you have to teach somebody else it."
As it turned out, I did not know much about many things. 
This I why I spend a lot of my free time learning and practicing my communication skills.

I really want to be the best I can be. 
Whether it is at my job or my physical performance. 
When I am not one with the computer, I am probably up keeping my health.
 
To me, health is wellness of the mind and body. 
Things like push-ups, pull-ups, and cycling are great way to maintain a happy body.
However, that is just half of the equation. 
Keeping a positive outlook on life, being great to others, and not letting negative stress overwhelm you is the other half.
I am always facing forward, only looking back to help others with things I have done, so they can do it better. 

When building software, sometimes it takes the longest amount of time to find the tiniest bug. 
Hopefully I can provide someone tweezers!
